# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them.

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

Versions in parentheses coincide with [specification files](https://sci-f.github.io/spec).

## [1.0.0](https://sci-f.github.io/spec-v1) (1.0.0)

 - inital formalization of standard into version 1.0.0 documentation from [vsoch.github.io/scif](https://vsoch.github.io/scif)
 - added GoLang client link [https://www.github.com/sci-f/scif-go](https://www.github.com/sci-f/scif-go)
