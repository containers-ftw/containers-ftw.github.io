The Scientific Filesystem is an organizational format for scientific software and metadata. Our goals are centered around  **consistency**, **transparency**, **programmatic accessibility**, and **modularity**. [Read about](https://sci-f.github.io) the format.

## Clients
Please contribute to the clients below, or the specification here.

 - [vsoch/scif](https://github.com/vsoch/scif) is the Python client, ideal for scientific use cases, or if you want interactivity
 - [sci-f/scif-go](https://www.github.com/sci-f/scif-go) is the GoLang library, intended for use with GoLang projects.

Both can be installed and used in a container base. See the [documentation](https://vsoch.github.io) for quick starts.
